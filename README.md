# Assignment 3 - Project Harrismus

Welcome to the repo for Project Harrismus. We are making a 'imgur-like' project, which allows users to upload images as a post, view filtered feeds of user's posts, and vote posts up or down within the feeds. 

# Set-up
You will need NPM and Node installed previously. *(test using `npm -version`)*

1. Clone the repo
2. Open terminal and do `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run with `npm run`

*Note*: node execution does not work due to the use of ES6 code e.g. imports

# Structure
